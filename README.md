Description:
This is an efficient toolbox for electrophysiological data analysis.

Functions:
read ABF files,
batch calculate Ra and Rm for data quality control,
batch analyze charge of EPSC or IPSC, pair-pulse ratio, amplitudes of action potentials and spike adaption automatically,
and finally batch output organized results in Excel files.

Contribution:
Mingcan Yu designed, developed and improved this toolbox.
Junying Wang tested it with her experimental data, checked its results with her manual analysis and provided the feedback.
